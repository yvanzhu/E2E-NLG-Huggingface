# E2E-NLG-Huggingface

This Notebook is based on Huggingface and Running under Colab Notebook.

The E2E dataset will be downloaded by the first code line.

In 'Play with test set' section, you can either generated text with your trained model (run the previous sections by yourself) or you can use the our fine-tuned model based on BART pre-trained model (You need to download some dependencies as the beginning of this Notebook). See the comments in Notebook carefully. 

The fine-tuned model is also avaliable under : https://huggingface.co/Yvanzhu/E2E-NLG-Bart-best/tree/main

You can also find our another approach from scratch for this project under : https://git.tu-berlin.de/qiaw99/data-to-text-generation-for-task-oriented-dialog-systems/-/tree/tf_scratch_v0.0.0 The contributor is @qiaw99
